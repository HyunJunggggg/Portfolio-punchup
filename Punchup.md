# Portfolio Punch-Up: Interactive Pixel Character (MS Paint Concept)

## Overall Objective

I wanted to add a small interactive component to my portfolio that feels personal, playful, and captures my playful interest in electronic objects and digital components.  
My portfolio as a whole has a consistent visual language inspired by electronic devices and mechanical objects I enjoy TVs, computer parts, keyboards, and other digital components.  
This project draws from that same visual world, creating a piece that fits naturally as a **React component** in the About Me section, adding a playful, interactive moment while complementing the overall atmosphere.

By designing it this way, the component not only reflects my personality but can also be reused in other sections or projects if needed.

## Concept Overview

- **Visual style:** MS Paint–inspired background, simple, approachable
- **Character:** Pixel version of me, playful and expressive
- **Interaction:** Four buttons that change the character’s state
- **Context:** About Me page component

I loved playing with Microsoft Paint as a kid, and I wanted to bring a bit of that feeling back.  
The pixel character acts like a little avatar of me in this digital world, fitting naturally into the About Me section while reflecting the electronic and mechanical objects that inspire the rest of my portfolio.

## Interaction Breakdown

Each button reveals a different “side” of me when I’m not designing:

- **Drinking coffee / relaxing:** enjoying a warm cup and a little pause in the day
- **Surfing / adventurous:** out in the water, exploring and having fun
- **Traveling / exploring:** discovering new places, experiencing different cultures
- **Acrylic painting / creative:** focused on painting and making something with my hands

The changes are subtle expressions, gestures, small movements, so visitors can connect with the character in their own way.  
Each state gives a glimpse into different aspects of my personality, showing that design is just one part of who I am.

- Figma (for lo-fi mockups and interaction planning)
- React / JSX (for building interactive component)
- CSS for styling and hover/click effects (If it needs )
- Optional sprite/frame-based animations for pixel character

## Hopes & Concerns

I hope the interaction feels alive and engaging for visitors, without being overwhelming or confusing.  
I wonder whether users will actually notice and play with the component, or if it will feel too subtle.  
From a coding perspective, I’m unsure how to implement the hover/click interactions smoothly and responsively, and I want to make sure it works across different devices while still keeping the playful personality intact.

## In Short

This punch up turns a childhood memory MS Paint into an interactive window into my world.  
It’s small, playful, and human. Visitors can click, explore, and see a side of me that goes beyond words.  
It’s a tiny reminder that design isn’t just what I make it’s also who I am.
